# Your Name.
How do you know the names of the people who live on the unknown island you arrive at?

This mod makes it more important to ask the people you are talking to about their *Background*.

## Feature
Outlander doesn't know names of people, not even Fargoth. By talking to the person and asking his or her name, it will recognize the person's name.
If you get a partial name out of them, that is the only part.

## Options
- NPCs and creatures whose names are unknown can be filtered by their attributes.
  - Essentials, Persistent Corpses, Guards and Talking Creatures.
  - NPCs with non-unique names are not included.
- Allows some control of how persons with unknown names are displayed.
- If you don't meet that person for a long time, you will forget his or her name. This is dependent on skills and attributes.

## Limitation
- The name is revealed only when he or she identifies himself or herself. If another person mentions that person, Outlander will not recognize him or her.
- Outlander may talk about the person in his/her diary even though he/she does not yet know the person's name.
- Sometimes people do not even give their own names completely. Their names remain partially or completely unknown.
- Dead men tell no tales.
- It has not been tested except in the English version, so it won't work well.

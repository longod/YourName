# Your Name.
How do you know the names of the people who live on an island you've never seen?

This mod makes it more important to ask about their **Background**.

It brings more freshness and immersion to gameplay, but may make gameplay more difficult.
I recommend to start a new game when using this mod, as memories will accumulate. because if you use this mod in the middle of a game, you will forget all the names of the people you meet.


## Features
- You don't know anyone by name, not even Fargoth.
- By talking to the person and asking his or her name, you can remember that name.
- If you get a partial name out of them, that is the only part. The rest remains unknown.
- If you don't meet that person for a long time, you will forget his or her name. A skill and attributes allow you to remember them for a long time.


## Options
- People and creatures whose names will be unknown can be filtered by their properties.
  - Essential, Persistent Corpse, Guard, No Lore and Talking Creature.
- You can control how the names of people whose names you do not know are displayed.
- Memory forgettingcan be disabled. Some people are named only once.


## Limitations
- The name is revealed only when the person says his or her name. If another person mentions that person, Outlander can't recognize him or her as that person.
- Outlander may write in his or her journal as if he or she knows the person's name, even though he or she does not yet know the person's name.
- Sometimes people do not even give their own names completely. Their names remain partially or completely unknown. The option possibly allows their name to be displayed.
- Dead men tell no tales.
- It has only been tested in the English version, otherwise it will not work well.

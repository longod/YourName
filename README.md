# Your Name.
How do you know the names of the people who live on the unknown island you arrive at?

This mod makes it more important to ask the people you are talking to about their *Background*.

It brings more immersive, but may make gameplay more difficult.
I recommend to start a new game when using this mod, as memories will accumulate. because if you use this mod in the middle of a game, you will forget all the names of the people you used to know.


## Features
- Outlander doesn't know names of people, not even Fargoth.
- By talking to the person and asking his or her name, its name will be remembered.
- If you get a partial name out of them, that is the only part.
- If you don't meet that person for a long time, you will forget his or her name. This is dependent on a skill and attributes.


## Options
- NPCs and creatures whose names will be unknown can be filtered by their properties.
  - Essential, Persistent Corpse, Guard, No Lore and Talking Creature.
- Allows some control of how persons with unknown names are displayed.
- Forgetting memory can be disabled. There are NPCs who are named only once.


## Limitations
- The name is revealed only when he or she identifies himself or herself. If another person mentions that person, Outlander will not recognize him or her.
- Outlander may talk about the person in his or her journal even though he or she does not yet know the person's name.
- Sometimes people do not even give their own names completely. Their names remain partially or completely unknown.
- Dead men tell no tales.
- It has not been tested except in the English version, so it won't work well.

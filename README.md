# Your Name.
This mod makes it more important to ask the people you are talking to about their *Background*.

How do you know the names of all the dwellers on this first unknown island you are about to arrive on?

## Limitation
- The name is revealed only when he or she identifies himself or herself. If another person mentions that person, Outlander will not recognize him or her.
- Outlander may talk about the person in his/her diary even though he/she does not yet know the person's name.
- Sometimes people do not even give their own names completely. Their names remain partially or completely unknown.
